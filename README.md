## Usage
---

1. Open the web application in your web browser by following the installation instructions mentioned above.

2. On the main page, you will find a form where you can specify your preferences for activity suggestions.

3. Fill out the form by selecting from the number of participants, type of activity, and price range dropdown menus. The forms option include:

   - Number of Participants: 1-5
   - Activity Type: relaxation, charity, recreational, busywork, education, social, cooking, diy, and music
   - Price: `$`, `$$`, and `$$$`

   Each selection also offers a "random" option if you can't be bothered.

4. Once you have selected your desired parameter values, click on the "Submit" button.

5. The web application will generate six different cards tailored to your inputs. The more unlikely your input combination,
the less likely the suggestions won't repeat themselves.

6. Explore the suggested activities displayed on the same page beside the form. Each card may include an option number, a suggestion, and the activity's accessibility.

7. If you want to generate new suggestions, simply modify the form parameters, or don't, and click the "Submit" button again.
